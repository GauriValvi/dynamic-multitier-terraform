📄 Project Description

This project provisions a dynamic multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. It includes automated deployment of a highly available and scalable infrastructure consisting of a VPC, public and private subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, security groups, and EC2 instances for web and application tiers. The setup is modular and parameterized, allowing flexible environment scaling and reusability across different stages (dev, staging, prod).

🛠️ Tools Used

Terraform – To define and manage infrastructure as code across all tiers.
AWS VPC – To create isolated network environments.
AWS EC2 – For hosting application and web servers across tiers.
AWS Subnets (Public & Private) – For organizing and securing resources based on accessibility.
Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway – For enabling internet access to public and private instances respectively.
Security Groups – To control inbound and outbound traffic rules.
Terraform Modules & Variables – For reusable and dynamic infrastructure design.
